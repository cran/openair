\title{Tools for the analysis of air pollution data}
\description{
This is a UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
funded knowledge exchange project that aims to make available innovative
analysis tools for air pollution data; with additional support from
Defra. The tools have generally been developed to analyse data of
hourly resolution (or at least a regular time series) both for air
pollution monitoring and dispersion modelling. The availability of
meteorological data at the same time resolution greatly enhances the
capabilities of these tools.
}
\details{
The project code is also developed using R-Forge
(\url{http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/openair/}).

\code{openair} contains collection of functions to analyse air pollution
data. Typically it is expected that data are hourly means, although most
functions consider other time periods. The principal aim to make
available analysis techniques that most users of air quality data and
model output would not normally have access to. The functions consist of
those developed by the authors and a growing number from other
researchers.

The package also provides access to a wide range of data
sources including the UK Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN),
networks run by King's College London (e.g. the LAQN) and the Scottish Air
Quality Network (SAQN).

The package has a number of requirements for input data and these are
discussed in the manual (available on the \code{openair} website at
\url{http://www.openair-project.org}). The key requirements are that a
date or date-time field must have the name `date' (and can be
\code{Date} or \code{POSIXct} format), that wind speed is represented as
`ws' and that wind direction is `wd'.

Most functions work in a very straightforward way, but offer many
options for finer control and perhaps more in-depth analysis.

The \code{openair} package depends on several other packages written by
other people to function properly.

To ensure that these other packages are available, they need to be
installed, and this requires a connection to the internet. Other
packages required come with the R base system.  If there are problems
with the automatic download of these packages, see
\url{http://www.openair-project.org} for more details.

NOTE: openair assumes that data are not expressed in local time where
'Daylight Saving Time' is used. All functions check that this is the
case and issue a warning if TRUE. It is recommended that data are
expressed in UTC/GMT (or a fixed offset from) to avoid potential
problems with R and \code{openair} functions. The \code{openair} manual
provides advice on these issues (available on the website).

To check to see if \code{openair} has been correctly installed, try some
of the examples below.

# load example data from package
data(mydata)

# summarise the data in a compact way
\dontrun{summaryPlot(mydata)}

# traditional wind rose
windRose(mydata)

# basic plot
\dontrun{polarPlot(mydata, pollutant = "nox")}
