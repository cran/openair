\usage{
selectByDate(
  mydata,
  start = "1/1/2008",
  end = "31/12/2008",
  year = 2008,
  month = 1,
  day = "weekday",
  hour = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{A data frame containing a \code{date} field in hourly or high
resolution format.}

\item{start}{A start date string in the form d/m/yyyy e.g. \dQuote{1/2/1999}
or in \sQuote{R} format i.e. \dQuote{YYYY-mm-dd}, \dQuote{1999-02-01}}

\item{end}{See \code{start} for format.}

\item{year}{A year or years to select e.g. \code{year = 1998:2004} to select
1998-2004 inclusive or \code{year = c(1998, 2004)} to select 1998 and
2004.}

\item{month}{A month or months to select. Can either be numeric e.g.
\code{month = 1:6} to select months 1-6 (January to June), or by name e.g.
\code{month = c("January", "December")}. Names can be abbreviated to 3
letters and be in lower or upper case.}

\item{day}{A day name or or days to select. \code{day} can be numeric (1 to
31) or character. For example \code{day = c("Monday", "Wednesday")} or
\code{day = 1:10} (to select the 1st to 10th of each month). Names can be
abbreviated to 3 letters and be in lower or upper case. Also accepts
\dQuote{weekday} (Monday - Friday) and \dQuote{weekend} for convenience.}

\item{hour}{An hour or hours to select from 0-23 e.g. \code{hour = 0:12} to
select hours 0 to 12 inclusive.}

\description{
Utility function to make it easier to select periods from a data frame
before sending to a function
}
\details{
This function makes it much easier to select periods of interest from a data
frame based on dates in a British format. Selecting date/times in R format
can be intimidating for new users. This function can be used to select quite
complex dates simply - see examples below.

Dates are assumed to be inclusive, so \code{start = "1/1/1999"} means that
times are selected from hour zero. Similarly, \code{end = "31/12/1999"} will
include all hours of the 31st December. \code{start} and \code{end} can also
be in standard R format as a string i.e. "YYYY-mm-dd", so \code{start =
"1999-01-01"} is fine.

All options are applied in turn making it possible to select quite complex
dates
}
\examples{

## select all of 1999
data.1999 <- selectByDate(mydata, start = "1/1/1999", end = "31/12/1999")
head(data.1999)
tail(data.1999)

# or...
data.1999 <- selectByDate(mydata, start = "1999-01-01", end = "1999-12-31")

# easier way
data.1999 <- selectByDate(mydata, year = 1999)


# more complex use: select weekdays between the hours of 7 am to 7 pm
sub.data <- selectByDate(mydata, day = "weekday", hour = 7:19)

# select weekends between the hours of 7 am to 7 pm in winter (Dec, Jan, Feb)
sub.data <- selectByDate(mydata, day = "weekend", hour = 7:19, month =
c("dec", "jan", "feb"))
