\title{Import monitoring site meta data for the UK and European networks}
\usage{
importMeta(source = "aurn", all = FALSE, duplicate = FALSE, year = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{One or more sources of meta data. Can be \code{aurn}, \code{saqn} (or
\code{saqd}), \code{aqe}, \code{waqn}, \code{ni}, \code{local} (or \code{lmam}), \code{kcl} or \code{europe}; upper
or lower case.}

\item{all}{When \code{all = FALSE} only the site code, site name, latitude and
longitude and site type are imported. Setting \code{all = TRUE} will import all
available meta data and provide details (when available) or the individual
pollutants measured at each site.}

\item{duplicate}{Some UK air quality sites are part of multiple networks, so
could appear more than once when \code{source} is a vector of two or more. The
default argument, \code{FALSE}, drops duplicate sites. \code{TRUE} will return them.}

\item{year}{If a single year is selected, only sites that were open at some
point in that year are returned. If \code{all = TRUE} only sites that
measured a particular pollutant in that year are returned. Year can also be
a sequence e.g. \code{year = 2010:2020} or of length 2 e.g. \code{year =
  c(2010, 2020)}, which will return only sites that were open over the
duration. Note that \code{year} is ignored when the \code{source} is either
\code{"kcl"} or \code{"europe"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with meta data.

\description{
Function to import meta data for air quality monitoring sites
}
\details{
This function imports site meta data from several networks in the UK and
Europe:
\itemize{
\item \code{"aurn"},  The UK Automatic Urban and Rural Network.
\item \code{"saqn"},  The Scottish Air Quality Network.
\item \code{"waqn"},  The Welsh Air Quality Network.
\item \code{"ni"},  The Northern Ireland Air Quality Network.
\item \code{"aqe"},  The Air Quality England Network.
\item \code{"local"},  Locally managed air quality networks in England.
\item \code{"kcl"},  King's College London networks.
\item \code{"europe"},  Import hourly European data (Airbase/e-reporting) based on a
simplified version of the \code{saqgetr} package.
}

By default, the function will return the site latitude, longitude and site
type. If the option \code{all = TRUE} is used, much more detailed information is
returned. For most networks, this detailed information includes per-pollutant
summaries, opening and closing dates of sites etc.

Thanks go to Trevor Davies (Ricardo), Dr Stuart Grange (EMPA) and Dr Ben
Barratt (KCL) and  for making these data available.

\dontrun{
# basic info
meta <- importMeta(source = "aurn")

# more detailed information:
meta <- importMeta(source = "aurn", all = TRUE)

# from the Scottish Air Quality Network
meta <- importMeta(source = "saqn", all = TRUE)

# from multiple networks
meta <- importMeta(source = c("aurn", "aqe", "local"))
}
