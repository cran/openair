\arguments{
\item{mydata}{A data frame containing at least two numeric variables to
plot.}

\item{x}{Name of the x-variable to plot. Note that x can be a date field or
a factor. For example, \code{x} can be one of the \code{openair} built in
types such as \code{"year"} or \code{"season"}.}

\item{y}{Name of the numeric y-variable to plot.}

\item{z}{Name of the numeric z-variable to plot for \code{method =
"scatter"} or \code{method = "level"}. Note that for \code{method =
"scatter"} points will be coloured according to a continuous colour
scale, whereas for \code{method = "level"} the surface is coloured.}

\item{method}{Methods include \dQuote{scatter} (conventional scatter plot),
\dQuote{hexbin} (hexagonal binning using the \code{hexbin} package).
\dQuote{level} for a binned or smooth surface plot and \dQuote{density} (2D
kernel density estimates).}

\item{group}{The grouping variable to use, if any. Setting this to a
variable in the data frame has the effect of plotting several series in
the same panel using different symbols/colours etc. If set to a variable
that is a character or factor, those categories or factor levels will be
used directly. If set to a numeric variable, it will split that variable
in to quantiles.}

\item{avg.time}{This defines the time period to average to. Can be
\dQuote{sec}, \dQuote{min}, \dQuote{hour}, \dQuote{day},
\dQuote{DSTday}, \dQuote{week}, \dQuote{month}, \dQuote{quarter}
or \dQuote{year}. For much increased flexibility a number can
precede these options followed by a space. For example, a
timeAverage of 2 months would be \code{period = "2 month"}. See
function \code{timeAverage} for further details on this.  This
option se useful as one method by which the number of points
plotted is reduced i.e. by choosing a longer averaging time.}

\item{data.thresh}{The data capture threshold to use (%) when aggregating
the data using \code{avg.time}. A value of zero means that all available
data will be used in a particular period regardless if of the number of
values available. Conversely, a value of 100 will mean that all data will
need to be present for the average to be calculated, else it is recorded
as \code{NA}. Not used if \code{avg.time = "default"}.}

\item{statistic}{The statistic to apply when aggregating the data; default
is the mean. Can be one of "mean", "max", "min", "median", "frequency",
"sd", "percentile". Note that "sd" is the standard deviation and
"frequency" is the number (frequency) of valid records in the period.
"percentile" is the percentile level (%) between 0-100, which can be set
using the "percentile" option - see below. Not used if \code{avg.time =
"default"}.}

\item{percentile}{The percentile level in \% used when \code{statistic =
"percentile"} and when aggregating the data with \code{avg.time}. The
default is 95. Not used if \code{avg.time = "default"}.}

\item{type}{\code{type} determines how the data are split
i.e. conditioned, and then plotted. The default is will produce a
single plot using the entire data. Type can be one of the built-in
types as detailed in \code{cutData} e.g. \dQuote{season},
\dQuote{year}, \dQuote{weekday} and so on. For example, \code{type
= "season"} will produce four plots --- one for each
season.

It is also possible to choose \code{type} as another variable in
the data frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be
split into four quantiles (if possible) and labelled
accordingly. If type is an existing character or factor variable,
then those categories/levels will be used directly. This offers
great flexibility for understanding the variation of different
variables and how they depend on one another.

Type can be up length two e.g. \code{type = c("season",
"weekday")} will produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the
week. Note, when two types are provided the first forms the
columns and the second the rows.}

\item{smooth}{A smooth line is fitted to the data if \code{TRUE};
optionally with 95\% confidence intervals shown. For \code{method =
"level"} a smooth surface will be fitted to binned data.}

\item{spline}{A smooth spline is fitted to the data if \code{TRUE}. This is
particularly useful when there are fewer data points or when a connection
line between a sequence of points is required.}

\item{linear}{A linear model is fitted to the data if \code{TRUE};
optionally with 95\% confidence intervals shown. The equation of the line
and R2 value is also shown.}

\item{ci}{Should the confidence intervals for the smooth/linear fit be
shown?}

\item{mod.line}{If \code{TRUE} three lines are added to the
scatter plot to help inform model evaluation. The 1:1 line is
solid and the 1:0.5 and 1:2 lines are dashed. Together these lines
help show how close a group of points are to a 1:1 relationship
and also show the points that are within a factor of two
(FAC2). \code{mod.line} is appropriately transformed when x or y
axes are on a log scale.}

\item{cols}{Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
\dQuote{default}, \dQuote{increment}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet}
and \code{RColorBrewer} colours --- see the \code{openair}
\code{openColours} function for more details. For user defined the
user can supply a list of colour names recognised by R (type
\code{colours()} to see the full list). An example would be
\code{cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")}}

\item{plot.type}{\code{lattice} plot type. Can be \dQuote{p}
(points --- default), \dQuote{l} (lines) or \dQuote{b} (lines and
points).}

\item{key}{Should a key be drawn? The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{key.title}{The title of the key (if used).}

\item{key.columns}{Number of columns to be used in the key. With many
pollutants a single column can make to key too wide. The user can thus
choose to use several columns by setting \code{columns} to be less than
the number of pollutants.}

\item{key.position}{Location where the scale key is to plotted.  Allowed
arguments currently include \dQuote{top}, \dQuote{right}, \dQuote{bottom}
and \dQuote{left}.}

\item{strip}{Should a strip be drawn? The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{log.x}{Should the x-axis appear on a log scale? The default is
\code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} a well-formatted log10 scale is used. This
can be useful for checking linearity once logged.}

\item{log.y}{Should the y-axis appear on a log scale? The default is
\code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} a well-formatted log10 scale is used. This
can be useful for checking linearity once logged.}

\item{x.inc}{The x-interval to be used for binning data when \code{method =
"level"}.}

\item{y.inc}{The y-interval to be used for binning data when \code{method =
"level"}.}

\item{limits}{For \code{method = "level"} the function does its
best to choose sensible limits automatically. However, there are
circumstances when the user will wish to set different ones. The
limits are set in the form \code{c(lower, upper)}, so \code{limits
= c(0, 100)} would force the plot limits to span 0-100.}

\item{windflow}{This option allows a scatter plot to show the wind
speed/direction shows as an arrow. The option is a list
e.g. \code{windflow = list(col = "grey", lwd = 2, scale =
0.1)}. This option requires wind speed (\code{ws}) and wind
direction (\code{wd}) to be available.

The maximum length of the arrow plotted is a fraction of the plot
dimension with the longest arrow being \code{scale} of the plot
x-y dimension. Note, if the plot size is adjusted manually by the
user it should be re-plotted to ensure the correct wind angle. The
list may contain other options to \code{panel.arrows} in the
\code{lattice} package. Other useful options include
\code{length}, which controls the length of the arrow head and
\code{angle}, which controls the angle of the arrow head.

This option works best where there are not too many data to ensure
over-plotting does not become a problem.}

\item{y.relation}{This determines how the y-axis scale is
plotted. \dQuote{same} ensures all panels use the same scale and
\dQuote{free} will use panel-specific scales. The latter is a
useful setting when plotting data with very different values.}

\item{x.relation}{This determines how the x-axis scale is plotted. \dQuote{same}
ensures all panels use the same scale and \dQuote{free} will use panel-specific
scales. The latter is a useful setting when plotting data with very
different values.}

\item{ref.x}{See \code{ref.y} for details.}

\item{ref.y}{A list with details of the horizontal lines to be
added representing reference line(s). For example, \code{ref.y =
list(h = 50, lty = 5)} will add a dashed horizontal line at
50. Several lines can be plotted e.g. \code{ref.y = list(h = c(50,
100), lty = c(1, 5), col = c("green", "blue"))}. See
\code{panel.abline} in the \code{lattice} package for more details
on adding/controlling lines.}

\item{k}{Smoothing parameter supplied to \code{gam} for fitting a smooth
surface when \code{method = "level"}.}

\item{dist}{When plotting smooth surfaces (\code{method = "level"}
and \code{smooth = TRUE}, \code{dist} controls how far from the
original data the predictions should be made. See
\code{exclude.too.far} from the \code{mgcv} package. Data are
first transformed to a unit square. Values should be between 0 and
1.}

\item{map}{Should a base map be drawn? This option is under
development.}

\item{auto.text}{Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If
\code{TRUE} titles and axis labels will automatically try and format
pollutant names and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the \sQuote{2} in NO2.}

\item{...}{Other graphical parameters are passed onto
\code{cutData} and an appropriate \code{lattice} plot function
(\code{xyplot}, \code{levelplot} or \code{hexbinplot} depending on
\code{method}). For example, \code{scatterPlot} passes the option
\code{hemisphere = "southern"} on to \code{cutData} to provide
southern (rather than default northern) hemisphere handling of
\code{type = "season"}. Similarly, for the default case
\code{method = "scatter"} common axis and title labelling options
(such as \code{xlab}, \code{ylab}, \code{main}) are passed to
\code{xyplot} via \code{quickText} to handle routine
formatting. Other common graphical parameters, e.g. \code{layout}
for panel arrangement, \code{pch} for plot symbol and \code{lwd}
and \code{lty} for line width and type, as also available (see
examples below).

For \code{method = "hexbin"} it can be useful to transform the
scale if it is dominated by a few very high values. This is
possible by supplying two functions: one that that applies the
transformation and the other that inverses it. For log scaling
(the default) for example, \code{trans = function(x) log(x)} and
\code{inv = function(x) exp(x)}. For a square root transform use
\code{trans = sqrt} and \code{inv = function(x) x^2}. To not carry
out any transformation the options \code{trans = NULL} and
\code{inv = NULL} should be used.}

\value{
As well as generating the plot itself, \code{scatterPlot} also
  returns an object of class ``openair''. The object includes three main
  components: \code{call}, the command used to generate the plot;
  \code{data}, the data frame of summarised information used to make the
  plot; and \code{plot}, the plot itself. If retained, e.g. using
  \code{output <- scatterPlot(mydata, "nox", "no2")}, this output can be
  used to recover the data, reproduce or rework the original plot or
  undertake further analysis.

An openair output can be manipulated using a number of generic operations,
  including \code{print}, \code{plot} and \code{summary}.

\description{
Scatter plots with conditioning and three main approaches: conventional
scatterPlot, hexagonal binning and kernel density estimates. The former
also has options for fitting smooth fits and linear models with
uncertainties shown.
}
\details{
The \code{scatterPlot} is the basic function for plotting scatter plots in
flexible ways in \code{openair}. It is flexible enough to consider lots of
conditioning variables and takes care of fitting smooth or linear
relationships to the data.

There are four main ways of plotting the relationship between two
variables, which are set using the \code{method} option. The default
\code{"scatter"} will plot a conventional scatterPlot. In cases where there
are lots of data and over-plotting becomes a problem, then \code{method =
"hexbin"} or \code{method = "density"} can be useful. The former requires
the \code{hexbin} package to be installed.

There is also a \code{method = "level"} which will bin the \code{x} and
\code{y} data according to the intervals set for \code{x.inc} and
\code{y.inc} and colour the bins according to levels of a third variable,
\code{z}. Sometimes however, a far better understanding of the relationship
between three variables (\code{x}, \code{y} and \code{z}) is gained by
fitting a smooth surface through the data. See examples below.

A smooth fit is shown if \code{smooth = TRUE} which can help show the
overall form of the data e.g. whether the relationship appears to be linear
or not. Also, a linear fit can be shown using \code{linear = TRUE} as an
option.

The user has fine control over the choice of colours and symbol type used.

Another way of reducing the number of points used in the plots which can
sometimes be useful is to aggregate the data. For example, hourly data can
be aggregated to daily data. See \code{timePlot} for examples here.

By default plots are shown with a colour key at the bottom and in the case
of conditioning, strips on the top of each plot. Sometimes this may be
overkill and the user can opt to remove the key and/or the strip by setting
\code{key} and/or \code{strip} to \code{FALSE}. One reason to do this is to
maximise the plotting area and therefore the information shown.
