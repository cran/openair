\usage{
importSAQN(site = "gla4", year = 2009, pollutant = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{site}{Site code of the SAQN site to import e.g. "gla4" is Glasgow
Kerbside. Several sites can be imported with \code{site = c("gla4",
"ed")} --- to import Glasgow Kerbside and Edinbrugh Centre for example.}

\item{year}{Year or years to import. To import a sequence of years from
1990 to 2000 use \code{year = 1990:2000}. To import several specfic years
use \code{year = c(1990, 1995, 2000)} for example.}

\item{pollutant}{Pollutants to import. If omitted will import all
pollutants ffrom a site. To import only NOx and NO2 for example use
\code{pollutant = c("nox", "no2")}.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of hourly mean values with date in POSIXct
  class and time zone GMT.

\description{
Function for importing hourly mean Scottish Air Quality Network (SAQN)
archive data files for use with the \code{openair} package. Files are
imported from a remote server operated by AEA that provides air quality
data files as R data objects.
}
\details{
The \code{importSAQN} function has been written to make it easy to import
data from the Scottish Air Quality Network (SAQN) ---
\url{http://www.scottishairquality.co.uk/index.php}. AEA have provided
.RData files (R workspaces) of all individual sites and years for the SAQN.
These files are updated on a daily basis. This approach requires a link to
the Internet to work.

There are several advantages over the web portal approach where .csv files
are downloaded. First, it is quick to select a range of sites, pollutants
and periods (see examples below). Second, storing the data as .RData
objects is very efficient as they are about four times smaller than .csv
files --- which means the data downloads quickly and saves bandwidth.
Third, the function completely avoids any need for data manipulation or
setting time formats, time zones etc. Finally, it is easy to import many
years of data beyond the current limit of about 64,000 lines. The final
point makes it possible to download several long time series in one go. The
function also has the advantage that the proper site name is imported and
used in \code{openair} functions.

The site codes and pollutant names can be upper or lower case. The function
will issue a warning when data less than six months old is downloaded,
which may not be ratified.

The data are imported by stacking sites on top of one another and will have
field names \code{site}, \code{code} (the site code) and \code{pollutant}.
Sometimes it is useful to have columns of site data. This can be done using
the \code{reshape} function --- see examples below.

All units are expressed in mass terms for gaseous species (ug/m3 for NO,
NO2, NOx (as NO2), SO2; and mg/m3 for CO). PM10 concentrations are provided
in gravimetric units of ug/m3 or scaled to be comparable with these units.
Over the years a variety of instruments have been used to measure
particulate matter and the technical issues of measuring PM10 are complex.
In recent years the measurements rely on FDMS (Filter Dynamics Measurement
System), which is able to measure the volatile component of PM. In cases
where the FDMS system is in use there will be a separate volatile component
recorded as 'v10', which is already included in the absolute PM10
measurement. Prior to the use of FDMS the measurements used TEOM (Tapered
Element Oscillating. Microbalance) and these concentrations have been
multiplied by 1.3 to provide an estimate of the total mass including the
volatile fraction.

The few BAM (Beta-Attenuation Monitor) instruments that have been
incorporated into the network throughout its history have been scaled by
1.3 if they have a heated inlet (to account for loss of volatile particles)
and 0.83 if they do not have a heated inlet. The few TEOM instruments in
the network after 2008 have been scaled using VCM (Volatile Correction
Model) values to account for the loss of volatile particles. The object of
all these scaling processes is to provide a reasonable degree of comparison
between data sets and with the reference method and to produce a consistent
data record over the operational period of the network, however there may
be some discontinuity in the time series associated with instrument
changes.

No corrections have been made to teh PM2.5 data. The volatile component of
FDMS PM2.5 (where available) is shown in the 'v2.5' column.

While the function is being developed, the following site codes should help
